In this lesson we will review the basic syntax of R, including several common operators, vectors, and different types of variables. We will also discuss packages and how to install and load (or call) in the libraries for the packages you want to use.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)
```

## Syntax 

Syntax in computer programming is a set of rules that defines the structure of a language, similar to how we have rules for grammar and spelling. If you write a sentence with incorrect spelling or grammar, the sentence may not make sense. If you write code without proper syntax, the code won't be able to run and you'll get an error message. 

## Operators
```{r}
x <- 10 # assignment operator
y <- 25
z <- 100

x > y # greater than operator: 10 > 25?
x < y  # less than operator

x == y # equality operator
x != y # not equal to operator 

z > 50 & z < 200 # & is the "and" operator
z > 50 & z > 200

z > 50 | z > 200 # | is the "or" operator
```

## Vectors

- In R, a vector is the simplest type of data structure. It is "a single entity consisting of a collection of things"

```{r}
names <- c("Kevin", "Jenny", "Millie")

age <- c(20, 18, 33)

blue_eyes <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
```
