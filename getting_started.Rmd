To begin your coding journey, I recommend watching and following along with the below tutorials. In these tutorials you will:

- Learn how to install R and RStudio
- Become familiar with the basic setup and structure of RStudio (where we will spend essentially all of our time coding)
- Learn about *working directories* and *R Projects*
- Create your first .R and .Rmd scripts and see the differences between the two types of scripts. In our lessons, we will use .Rmd files, but I think it's important to learn about both
- Get a brief introduction to the world of `tidyverse`
- Learn about my typical workflow in R, where I also mention a few tips and tricks along the way
