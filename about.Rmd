<p> Hi `r emo::ji("wave")`

My name is Jenny Sloane and I'm currently a postdoc fellow in Health Services Research and Development at the Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness and Safety, which is associated with the Houston VA and Baylor College of Medicine. </p>

Here's a little bit about me, but for more details, please visit my [personal website](https://jennysloane.netlify.app/){target="_blank"}

## My Background and Education
My background is in cognitive psychology. I received my BA in psychology from the University of Maryland, my Masters of Science in experimental psychology from Syracuse University, and my PhD in cognitive psychology from University of New South Wales. My research interests include improving diagnostic decision-making, reducing errors in medicine, and studying the effects of interruptions and time-pressure on medical decision-making. 

## My Interests Include:
- Cognitive psychology
- Medical decision-making
- Data science
- Data analysis/statistics
- Teaching and mentoring

## Inspiration for this Website
During my years as a PhD student, I’ve had the pleasure to teach hundreds of students in several different psychology courses. However, my favorite courses have involved teaching R to students - many of whom had never heard of R before. 

After teaching these courses, I’m keen to share everything I learned about teaching R as I’m sure there are many people out there who have heard about R or want to learn, but have no idea where to start. If this is you, I hope you find this website helpful!
